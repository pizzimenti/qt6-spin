# Qt6-Spin

Qt6-Spin is a simple CPU graphics application implemented in Qt6 by GPT-4 with multiple human prompts, including the creation of this README. It leverages Qt6's OpenGL capabilities to render a 3D cube in a window on your screen. The cube spins, rendered in 3d efficiently.

Qt6-Spin uses the OpenGL library to create and draw a cube on a window. The cube is defined by vertices and drawn as a wireframe. A timer controls the rotation speed of the cube to create a smooth spinning animation.

## Installation

To install Qt6-Spin, you need to have Qt6 installed. You can download Qt6 from the official website at https://www.qt.io/download.

Once you have Qt6 installed, you can clone this repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pizzimenti/qt6-spin.git
cd qt6-spin
qmake
make
```

To run the application, you can then execute:

```
